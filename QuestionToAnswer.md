# Double : üìù Full-stack engineering challenge - I-Tung Chiang

## Questions:

* How long did you spend on this challenge?

    I spent around four and a half hours styling the UI took me more time than I thought.
* In your opinion, what are features that Double could work on that would be helpful for assistants when managing agendas?
    1. Customized agenda templates will save time that assistants don't need to build the agenda repeatedly.
    2. Spelling correction, people are likely to make mistakes; I think this function will be helpful.
    3. Customized calendar and layout, according to different CEOs/clients, assistants will need different layout and demand functions in different situations.
* If you had more time, what would you add or change in the codebase?

  For Level 4, since I don't have much time to implement the feature into the serveral component. If I have more time, I will write the code based on the existing code structure and implement the grouping function as a library instead of directly put it in the code. Also, for Level 2, I plan to build a pop-up window at the bottom corner, but with the limited time, I choose to use "alert" to let the user know the error. The tradeoff of using "alert" is that it will significantly reduce the user experience.
* Do you have any constructive feedback that you would like to share with our team?

 For level 2, it confuses me a bit. I am not sure about the specific feature that should be implemented, so I can only do it with my assumptions.
I am also a big fan of using emojis. There is a saying that an engineer who likes to use emojis must not be a bad engineer. üí™
Thank you for sending the challenge, it was fun and I try my best to finish the core feature with limited time. Let me know if you have any questions with it.
